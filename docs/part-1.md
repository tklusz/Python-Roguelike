# Python Roguelike Tutorial 2019 - Part 1.
Welcome to the first part of the Python Roguelike tutorial. By now you should have python, libtcodpy, and your editor set up (as well as your GitHub repository if you're using one).

### Objectives
The following are the objectives of the first part of the tutorial.
* Set up a root and default terminal using libtcodpy.
* Display a moveable character on the terminal.
* Create a total of 3 separate python files - engine, inputHandler, moveable.
* Make as much code as possible reusable for future sections of the tutorial.
* Set up a "Moveable" class that can be used to move any object, not just the player.
